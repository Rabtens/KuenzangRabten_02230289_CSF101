## 1. Introduction

This report documents the implementation of searching and sorting algorithms as required in Practical Assignment 2. The programs are command-line based and include menu options for selecting the desired operation. All required functions were implemented and tested.

## 3. Part A — Searching Algorithms

### 3.1 Overview

Part A provides two search operations: Linear Search (to find a student ID) and Binary Search (to find a score). The student IDs and scores are hardcoded lists as required.

### 3.2 Implementations (brief)

- **Linear Search:** Iterates through the student ID list and counts comparisons. Returns a 1-indexed position when found.
- **Binary Search:** Iterative binary search over a sorted list of scores. Counts comparisons and returns a 1-indexed position when found.

### 3.3 Sample Outputs

*Insert Screenshot: Output showing both menu options, a successful linear search, and a successful binary search.*

## 4. Part B — Sorting Algorithms

### 4.1 Overview

Part B provides three sorting operations: Bubble Sort (student names), Insertion Sort (test scores), and Quick Sort (book prices). Lists are hardcoded with the requested number of items.

### 4.2 Implementations (brief)

- **Bubble Sort:** Simple pairwise swapping to order names alphabetically (case-insensitive). The program also prints total swaps for basic analysis.
- **Insertion Sort:** Standard insertion sort to order numeric scores. The report displays sorted scores and the top five scores in descending order.
- **Quick Sort:** Implemented using the divide-and-conquer approach. A counter records the number of recursive calls for transparency.

### 4.3 Sample Outputs

*Insert Screenshot: Output showing bubble sort result, insertion sort result with top 5 scores, and quick sort result with recursive call count.*

## 5. Code Listing

*Insert the full Python code here (copy from GitHub files) — or attach the files.*

## 6. Testing & Remarks

- The programs were run on Python 3.8+.
- Inputs were validated for integer entry where appropriate.
- The programs are interactive; students must enter choices and values as prompted.

## 7. Conclusion

All required functions are implemented and work as expected. The code includes comments and is easy to follow. Screenshots are attached to show the program runs correctly.
